# RTC-Online-Voice-Chat
This project is a real time chat that uses "getUserMedia", "simple-peer" and "Socket.io" to work.

In order to create the certificates, I have used OpenSSL, and simply pasted them into the project folder.

I alse create a style similar to Whatsapp. If you want to create your own style, you can modify the file "style.css". If you want to modify the HTML you can delete almost everything except:

 * "ul" tag with id=message (Line 20)
 * "audio" tag (Line 23)
 * "form" tag (Line 25)
 
 Feel free to copy this code and make your own modifications ;)
